# Examples of chart configuration

Here is a collection of common configurations for the OpenTelemetry collector.  Each folder contains an example `values.yaml` and the resulting configurations that are generated by the opentelemetry-collector helm charts.

- [Agent only](agent-only)
- [Standalone only](standalone-only)
- [Agent and Standalone](agent-and-standalone)

The manifests are rendered using the `helm template` command and the specific example folder's values.yaml.
