# Contributing Guide

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Helm Charts Repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction

This repository hosts Helm charts for deploying OpenTelemetry components in Kubernetes. Your contributions help improve observability for everyone! Whether youâ€™re fixing a configuration, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, we appreciate your effort!

We'd love your help!

## Pre-requisites

To work with this repository, ensure you have:

- Helm 3.8+

- chart-testing (ct) 3.7+

- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)

- make (for automation)

### Platform Notes

Docker or Kubernetes cluster access (for testing chart installations)

## Workflow 

1. Fork this repository
1. Develop, and test your changes
1. Submit a pull request

Remember to always work in a branch of your local copy, as you might otherwise
have to contend with conflicts in master.

Please also see [GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#github-workflow)
section of general project contributing guide.

Local Run/Build

Testing

## Technical Requirements

* Must follow [Charts best practices](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_best_practices/)
* Must pass CI jobs for linting and installing changed charts with the
  [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) tool
* Any change to a chart requires a version bump following
  [semver](https://semver.org/) principles. See [Immutability](#immutability)
  and [Versioning](#versioning) below

Once changes have been merged, the release job will automatically run to package
and release changed charts.

## Immutability

Chart releases must be immutable. Any change to a chart warrants a chart version
bump even if it is only changed to the documentation.

## Versioning

The chart `version` should follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

All changes to a chart require a version bump, following semvar.

Any breaking (backwards incompatible) changes to a chart should:
1. Bump the MINOR version
2. In the README, under a section called "Upgrading", describe the manual steps
   necessary to upgrade to the new (specified) MAJOR version

## Examples

All charts maintain examples for the current version. After updating the version, examples must be updated with the `make generate-examples` target.

The default `generate-examples` command will update all charts.  In order generate a chart's examples you must have the chart's dependencies added to your helm repo.

If you need update a single chart's examples you can use the `CHARTS` variable.  For example, if you want to update only the collector chart's examples you can run `make generate-examples CHARTS=opentelemetry-collector`

New examples should be added as independent folders in the respective chart's `examples` folder.  Examples should always contain a `values.yaml` and a `rendered` folder.
