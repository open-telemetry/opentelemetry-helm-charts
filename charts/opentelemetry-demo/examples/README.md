# Examples of chart configuration

Here is a collection of common configurations for the OpenTelemetry demo.  Each folder contains an example `values.yaml` and the resulting configurations that are generated by the opentelemetry-demo helm charts.

- [Default configuration](default)
- [Public Hosted Ingress](public-hosted-ingress)

The manifests are rendered using the `helm template` command and the specific example folder's values.yaml.
