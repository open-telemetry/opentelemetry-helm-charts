# Examples of chart configuration

Here is a collection of common configurations for the OpenTelemetry collector. Each folder contains an example `values.yaml` and the resulting configurations that are generated by the opentelemetry-collector helm charts.

- [Daemonset only](daemonset-only)
- [Deployment only](deployment-only)
- [Daemonset and deployment](daemonset-and-deployment)
- [Log collection, including collector logs](daemonset-collector-logs)
- [Add component (hostmetrics)](daemonset-hostmetrics)

The manifests are rendered using the `helm template` command and the specific example folder's values.yaml.

Example (from root of the repo):

```sh
helm template --name-template example ./charts/opentelemetry-collector \
--values ./charts/opentelemetry-collector/examples/statefulset-with-pvc/values.yaml \
--output-dir ./charts/opentelemetry-collector/examples/statefulset-with-pvc/rendered
```
