# OpenTelemetry Collector CRDs

This chart contains the CRDs for _*installation*_ only right now for the opentelemetry-operator. This allows the OpenTelemetry Kubernetes Stack chart to work on install. You can see more discussion about this [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/issues/677) and [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/pull/1203).

This approach is inspired by the kube-prometheus-stack approach which you can see discussion on [here](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/issues/3548).

> [!NOTE]
> This chart explicitly _does not_ support the conversion webhook that is currently in the opentelemetry-operator chart. This is because the opentelemetry-kube-stack chart will only work with v1beta1 CRDs. This chart is not meant for use with v1alpha1 Collector CRDs.

# Upgrade Notes

Right now, upgrades are NOT handled by this chart, however that could change in the future. This is what is run to bring in the CRDs today.

> [!NOTE]
> The prometheus operator version should be equal to what is documented in the opentelemetry operator's compatability matrix [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#opentelemetry-operator-vs-kubernetes-vs-cert-manager-vs-prometheus-operator)
