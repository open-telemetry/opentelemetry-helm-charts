# OpAMP bridge configuration. The OpAMP Bridge is an OpenTelemetry component
# that enables enhanced configuration and health monitoring for OpenTelemetry collectors
# deployed in Kubernetes. The Bridge pulls collector CRDs from the Kubernetes cluster and
# reports their configuration and status to a remote OpAMP Server. The Bridge will only pull
# collectors labeled with either
# * opentelemetry.io/opamp-reporting: true
# * opentelemetry.io/opamp-managed: true
# You can learn more about the Bridge's design here:
# https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M8VLNe_sv1MIfu5bUR5OV_vrMBnAI7IJN-7-IAr37JY
